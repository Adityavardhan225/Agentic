      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up the specific version of Python we want to use
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4

        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Lint the code with flake8 to check for style issues
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
